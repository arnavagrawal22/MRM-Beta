    <h2 class="sub-heading">Why Sponsor Us? </h2>
    <p class="section-text">Mars Rover Manipal is a leading student project team of Manipal Academy of Higher
        Education. With each
        subsequent year, the team has built a better, more capable design with a better performance than the
        previous one. The team has been a consistent performer in University Rover Challenge, organized by Mars
        Society. Mars Society is the body concerned with the establishment of humans on Mars in future. The event is
        judged and attended by leading scientists of the world. Tech heads from all over the world, who will one day
        be leading technocrats, take part in the event. Our partner sponsors are featured in our merchandise which
        we wear in all our events. Our logo also has stickers of our sponsor companies. We sponsors from time to
        time on our social platforms like Facebook, Instagram and Youtube. Besides the competition, we put our work
        on display at TechTatva, MIT's national level technical festival. A fest with a reach like such can be a
        great platform for your company for advertisement. We regularly take part in tech competitions, where our
        rover has constantly performed well.
    </p>
    <p class="section-text">
        Sponsoring a team like us goes a long way in ensuring the Corporate Social Responsibility for your company.
        When you invest in us, you invest in the future of education. An autonomous rover can open doors to a large
        number of possibilities, ranging from disaster management to environment cleanliness. Your investment will
        allow us to further our research in to various fields, where humans can put these robots to use. Your help
        to us will further enhance the image of your company as one that works towards a better future for all of
        us.
    </p>
    <p class="section-text">Home to about 20,000 students from all parts of the world, very few colleges provide
        diversity, as Manipal
        Academy of Higher Education does. Joining our family of sponsors provides your company exposure to all of
        these students. Your company will come in direct contact with innovative and dedicated students, who are
        experienced and more than able to handle situations. As one of our sponsors, your company is invited to all
        our events and can visit our workshop any time. Our workshop is a place where you can have access to bright
        engineering students, who can be an asset to any company they join.
